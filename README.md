I'm a full-stack software engineer and avid challenge-chaser with a love for history. I recently completed a 6 month full stack software engineering bootcamp at App Academy, formalizing my **NYC freelancing** experience with over **2000 hours of grinding Javascript, Python**, et al. 

- Some things I'm working on: 
  * 📝 [Whatevernote](https://whatevernote-app.herokuapp.com/) : Python/React Evernote clone using React Quill Editor including custom undo and **autosave** functions. 
  * 📚 [My Groovy Library](https://my-public-library.herokuapp.com/) to explore the Google API & **OAuth2**
- 🐍  I’m currently learning Python 
- 👯 I’m looking to collaborate on any projects involving a camera or DeFi
- 💬 Ask me about NYC history if you have time
