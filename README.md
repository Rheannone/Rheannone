### Oh, hey!!  🥂


I'm a full-stack software engineer and avid challenge-chaser with a love for history. My hobbies include disassembling & reassembling old things, learning new programming languages, and caring for my pets. I recently completed a 6 month full stack software engineering bootcamp at App Academy, formalizing my NYC freelancing experience with over 2000 hours of JavaScript, Python, and other powerful coding languages.
